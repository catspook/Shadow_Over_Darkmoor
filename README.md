# The Shadow Over Darkmoor

The Shadow Over Darkmoor is a text-based roguelike adventure game set in the fictonal village of
Darkmoor. It runs off of the terminal (untested on Windows) and has a very gentle learning curve.

Over the last few weeks, travel to and from the town of Darkmoor has trickled to a halt, save for a few refugees who
whisper of necromancy and other horrors. These murmerings have reached the Queen's ears, and she has sent you
to find the truth and rescue the town of Darkmoor from its fate.

You arrive in Darkmoor as darkness falls. Your mission is simple: survive.

### Travel to over 100 unique locations!

Darkmoor is also customizable! To add more enemies, locations, or items to the game, alter the data files in 
src/darkmoor/model. 

## Build Tool

Darkmoor uses [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) to handle the builds/dependencies.

Source code can be run by running ```$ lein run``` anywhere in Darkmoor's file system.

To build a standalone jar run ```$ lein compile; lein uberjar```

This jar can then be ran with the command: ```$ java -jar target/uberjar/darkmoor-0.2.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar```
