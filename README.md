# The Shadow Over Darkmoor

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Build Tool

This application uses [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) to handle the builds/dependencies.

## Code

The code is located in 'src/darkmoor/core.clj', and requires text documents found in
the 'resources' file.

Source code can be run without compilation by running:
```$ lein run```
anywhere in Darkmoor's file system. This won't be as fast as running it off of a 
standalone jar.

To build a standalone jar:

    ```$ lein compile; lein uberjar```

Afterwhich that can be run with:

    ```$ java -jar target/uberjar/darkmoor-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar```
