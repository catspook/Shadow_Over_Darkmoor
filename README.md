# The Shadow Over Darkmoor

![Welcome.](/Shadow_Over_Darkmoor/master/pink-welcome.png?raw=true)
Over the last few weeks, travel to and from the town of Darkmoor has trickled to a halt, save for a few refugees who
whisper of necromancy and other horrors. These murmerings have reached the Queen's ears, and she has sent you
to find the truth and rescue the town of Darkmoor from its fate.

You arrive in Darkmoor as darkness falls. Your mission is simple: survive.

The Shadow Over Darkmoor is a text-based roguelike adventure game set in the fictonal village of
Darkmoor, and features 30 unique enemies, nearly 40 unique items, and over 100 unique locations to explore. 
Darkmoor runs off of the terminal and has a very gentle learning curve--gameplay is explained as the 
player progresses through the storyline.

Darkmoor is also customizable! To add more enemies, locations, or items to the game, alter the data files in 
src/darkmoor/model.
