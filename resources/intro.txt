 It is a chilly fall afternoon. A thin drizzle falls around you as you trudge down the lane on your way 
 to the small town of Darkmoor. Darkmoor is known to wizards and academics for its archives of arcane knowledge 
 and ancient cemetary--both of which have attracted more...unwelcome visitors in the past.

 Over the last few weeks, travel to and from Darkmoor has trickled to a halt, save for a few refugees who
 whisper of necromancy and other horrors. These murmerings have reached the Queen's ears, and she has sent you 
 to find the truth and rescue the town of Darkmoor from its fate.

 You arrive in Darkmoor as darkness falls. A low whispered chanting fills your ears, and shambling figures 
 hide just beyond the edge of sight.
 
 Your mission is simple: survive.
