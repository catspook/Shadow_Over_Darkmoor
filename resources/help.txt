 COMMANDS

 Most commands are single characters, such as 'x' or 'l'. Press the key that corresponds with the command, then hit 'ENTER'.

 MOVING
 
 You can move North, South, East, or West from most locations by typing 'n', 's', 'e', or 'w'. The game will inform you if
 you cannot move a certain direction. Some locations lead to other levels to explore: the game will give you the option to
 exit or enter one of these areas by typing 'x'.

 LOOTING AND INVENTORY
 
 Each location has weapons and armor you can add to your inventory and equip. Type 'l' to see what you can loot at your current
 location, and type 'i' to access your inventory. To specify a certain item in your commands, type the item's ID number after
 the letter command ('a1' or 'e24'). You can equip 2 weapons at a time; if you try to equip more, the last weapon equipped will
 be replaced with the new one.

 FIGHTING

 Sometimes enemies will attack you as you move to a new location. Enemies will always be weaker than you, but healing is limited
 so don't underestimate them! When you defeat an enemy, you will gain a Health Potion that can restore 25% of your health.
 
 DAMAGE TYPES

 Enemies have certain types of damages they are particularly weak to. These will be displayed on the screen when fighting. You will
 do 10% extra damage to an enemy for every item you have equipped that your enemy is weak to.
